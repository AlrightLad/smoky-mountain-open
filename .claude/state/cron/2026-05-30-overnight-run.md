# Overnight triage — 2026-05-30 (cycle AU)

**Started:** 2026-05-30T04:04:48Z (cron-fired; regen-all START)
**Finished:** 2026-05-30T04:04:54Z (regen-all "ALL DASHBOARDS REGENERATED" timestamp)
**Mode:** Heartbeat-only branch per runbook (FIQ + bug-reports inbox both absent)
**Cycle:** AU (81st consecutive empty-inbox cycle; ~1h3m wall-clock gap from cycle AT's 03:01:12Z regen START — 35th consecutive ~1h-cadence cycle since cycle M). **First cycle of the 2026-05-30 date.** Both the UTC clock (04:04Z) and the Founder-local clock (00:04 EDT, York PA UTC-4) agree on 2026-05-30 this cycle, so there is **no journal-date convention tension** to carry this cycle (unlike cycles S/AQ/AR/AS/AT, where 0X:0XZ UTC fell on the prior Founder-local evening). New date-stamped file opened per runbook step 4.

## Inbox state at run-start (cycle AU)

- `.claude/state/founder-input-queue/` — **directory does not exist** (`test -d` → MISSING)
- `.claude/state/bug-reports/` — **entire tree absent** (no `inbox/`, no `triaged/`)
- `.claude/state/founder_input_queue.json` — **file does not exist** (only `FIQ-` ids on disk are the FIQ-001 template examples inside `docs/FOUNDER_INPUT_QUEUE.md`, schema illustration, NOT live queue entries)
- `.claude/state/escalations/{inbox,pending}/` — empty (`.gitkeep` only)
- `.claude/state/proposals/pending/` — only `.gitkeep` (no pending proposals)
- Working tree at run-start: a coherent uncommitted **v8.23.35 feature ship** from a **live concurrent session** (see Blockers §1) — `M src/pages/home-rail-newuser.js`, `M src/core/firebase.js`, `M src/core/router.js`, `M src/core/utils.js`, `M src/pages/caddynotes.js`, `M index.html`, `M package.json`, `M public/sw.js`, `M .claude/state/emu-unified-2026-05-29.log`; untracked `.pw-fullsweep.log`, `.pw-spec06.log`, `.pw-verify.log`. HEAD = `67ac1e9d`.

Per runbook: "If the FIQ queue + bug-reports inbox are BOTH empty: do steps 3-5 only and exit."

## Step 1 — FIQ triage (cycle AU)

- FIQ entries triaged: **0** (queue directory + json store both absent)
- Grade breakdown: N/A — A:0 B:0 C:0 D:0 F:0
- IDs: none

## Step 2 — Bug-report triage (cycle AU)

- Bug reports processed: **0** (inbox tree absent)
- Dispositions: none
- No P3e discussion bubbles opened (nothing to deliberate)

## Step 3 — Heartbeat (cycle AU)

### 3a — `scripts/regen-all.ps1`

- Ran end-to-end 04:04:48Z → 04:04:54Z: **=== ALL CHECKS PASSED ===**, **round-trip test PASS**. 36th consecutive clean canonical regen-all (cycles L–AU).
- Heartbeat `regen-all-last-pass.json` written.
- Telemetry snapshot: events=16702 handoffs=1 bubbles=7 proposals_pending=0, meter_status=wired-real → HALT-25 NOT in effect. Token aggregate (all-time): real=12,519,459,628 estimated=14,412,530 manual=0.
- All ~30 guards green (round-trip 4-view swap + transcript tallies + nav 9-link + meter-wiring 7/7 + founder-queue 7/7 + quota-type-enum + cross-dash proposals_pending=0 + lifecycle proposals shipped=7 + amendments applied=28 + escalations applied=3 + theme convergence no raw hex + no-charts + protected-layouts 5/5 + 23/23 + 17 swatches + W1.S1 + proposal-readiness 0 deferred + install-scripts 7 parse + install-cmd-surface + scroll-reachability 5/0/0 + quota-status auto-derived + pause-discipline clean + wiring 5/5).
- App health: **A- (87.1)**, 1 attention item. Founder-checklist: open=6 (red=0 yellow=4 green=2) closed_total=25.
- One INFORMATIONAL `~` (not a failure): `user-context-gate` flags `main-flows.html` modified 21717.3 min after the last user-context capture (2026-05-14T23-07-48Z). Benign on a heartbeat-only night with no visual ship-close.

**Working-tree diff after regen — `docs/reports/app-health.html` is PURELY metadata.** Proven by reading the diff verbatim AND grepping it for `overall_score` / `overall_grade` / `score` / `status` / `pre_deduction` / `post_deduction` / `dimension` changes (returns EMPTY). The only `+/-` lines are: (a) `generated_at` 2026-05-30T03:10:13Z → 04:04:53Z, and (b) `audit_trigger` commit-pointer re-pointing `sha` 370732fa ("Overnight triage 2026-05-29…", trigger=substrate-commit) → 67ac1e9d ("cron(routine): post-commit dashboard regen…", trigger=cron). All 12 dimension values byte-unchanged; **overall stays 87.1 (A-)**. Cleaner than cycle AT (which had a score-neutral A11 spec-label text move) — the concurrent session's spec cleanup already landed in the committed baseline, so cycle AU has zero non-metadata app-health diff lines.

### 3b — Wellness refresh

- `.claude/state/wellness/engineer.json` — updated for cycle AU (counters ~1,150k tokens cumulative / 1.0h discrete-context; status `active`; thresholds_crossed=['tokens_consumed'] preserved 45th cross-cycle; full cycle-AU `_note` + `substantive_output_at_checkpoint`).
- No other agent wellness files created — Critic + Data-Integrity were thinking-roles only tonight (attestation + inbox verification); no counter-reset-significant state to merit fresh files. Same disposition as cycles L–AT.

## Step 4 — Session journal

**This file** (new date-stamped journal for the 2026-05-30 date).

## Cycle AU counts

| Metric | Count |
|---|---|
| FIQ entries triaged | 0 |
| Bug reports processed | 0 |
| New proposals authored | 0 |
| Wellness state changes | 1 (engineer.json cycle AU refresh) |

## Blockers requiring Founder attention (cycle AU)

**No ship-blocking issues introduced by triage.** Awareness / carry-over items:

1. **LIVE CONCURRENT FEATURE SESSION — uncommitted v8.23.35 member-visible ship (NEW characterization this cycle; Founder decision pending).** The dirty tree is **not** random drift — it is a coherent, version-synced, member-visible ship that a concurrent interactive session was building and Playwright-verifying when it paused. Proof it is **live** (not stale): `tests/e2e/helpers/auth.js` became modified AND `.pw-verify2.log` appeared *during* this cycle's regen-all run (neither was in the run-start snapshot); `.pw-verify.log` mtime was 2026-05-29 23:54 EDT (after the last cron commit at 23:11). Contents of the ship:
   - **Version trio synced 8.23.34 → 8.23.35**: `package.json` `version`, `src/core/utils.js` `APP_VERSION`, `public/sw.js` `CACHE_NAME = 'parbaughs-v8.23.35'` — all consistent (Hook 5 version-sync would pass).
   - **`src/core/router.js`**: durable Firestore-backed dedup for the `profile_reminder` notification. Previously the in-memory `_sentProfileNotif` flag reset every session, so an incomplete profile spawned a fresh reminder on every app-open and flooded the panel. New code queries `notifications` where `toUserId == uid && type == 'profile_reminder'` (limit 1) before sending; never re-sends if one exists. Real bug fix.
   - **`src/core/firebase.js`**: `db.settings({ experimentalForceLongPolling: true })` inside the `emulator=1` branch only — fixes Playwright webkit/headless Firestore WebChannel stalls that timed out `{ source: 'server' }` fetches. **Emulator-only; production keeps default detection.**
   - **`index.html`**: CSP `frame-src` directive added (`'self'` + firebaseapp / googleapis / apis.google.com / gstatic + emulator auth ports 9099) — supports the auth iframe.
   - **`src/pages/home-rail-newuser.js`**: `data-stat` / `data-count` attributes added to the rounds / handicap / best stats strip — visual-smoke-assertion DOM hooks (matches the P8 convention).
   - **`src/pages/caddynotes.js`**: one new member-facing "FIXED" note describing the profile-reminder dedup + CSP tightening + release safety-checks (Caddy Notes per the operational principle).
   - **Founder action:** the concurrent session needs to finish E2E verification and commit this under its own `feat`/`fix` message (NOT a triage commit). **This triage cycle deliberately did NOT stage or commit any of it** — finalizing another author's unreviewed, member-visible ship would cross the runbook "DO NOT auto-anything that crosses a Founder-decision boundary" line (the caddy note changes what all 20 members see) and risk committing mid-edit/unverified work. Left exactly as the author had it.
2. **Carry-over — `A12_operational` 60/yellow** (pipeline sub-state red). Driven by the downloads-watcher correctly skipping the live-dirty tree (10 recent skip-dirty). Self-resolves the moment the v8.23.35 session commits (cycle AP demonstrated 60→90). NOT triage-caused, NOT a committed-code regression. **No proposal manufactured** — authoring one for a self-resolving carry-over would be ship-count gaming per METRIC_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL Rule 2.
3. **Carry-over — writer-side BOM fix (`scripts/common.ps1`) remains unauthored as a proposal.** Consumer-side `utf-8-sig` tolerance has now held 36 consecutive clean regen-all runs (cycles L–AU). Deliberately not auto-promoted without a Founder priority signal.
4. **Carry-over — journal-date convention (UTC vs Founder-local) for filename + commit date.** Not in tension this cycle (both = 2026-05-30) but unresolved as policy; Founder may want to lock which is canonical.
5. **Cron cadence** — cycles M–AU steady at ~1h. Awareness only.

## Cycle AU Critic metric-integrity attestation (per `METRIC_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL § 3.1`)

1. **"Did every bug report processed get a real diagnosis with cited evidence?"** N/A — zero bug reports tonight (inbox tree absent, verified by directory checks). Cannot wave off what doesn't exist.
2. **"Did every new proposal cite a specific screen/state/edge-case?"** N/A — zero new proposals tonight. The A12 60/yellow carry-over and the BOM fix were both deliberately *not* promoted (self-resolving / no Founder priority) rather than inflated into proposals.
3. **"Did the FIQ grades reflect rubric dimensions honestly?"** N/A — zero FIQ entries tonight. Queue absent; the only `FIQ-` ids on disk are governance-doc template examples, explicitly distinguished rather than mis-counted as triageable work.

**Heartbeat-only self-check — is tonight's substantive output real?** YES, modestly. A 36th consecutive clean canonical regen-all confirms the gate is durable. The app-health drift was inspected hunk-by-hunk AND grepped for score/status/dimension changes to *prove* it is metadata-only (clock + commit-pointer; overall flat at 87.1). The genuinely new substantive observation this cycle is the precise characterization of the live concurrent **v8.23.35** ship — read from its actual diff hunks (not guessed), proven live via mid-run file changes, and correctly left untouched rather than finalized. Every claim is anchored to a quoted regen-all log line, a `git diff` hunk read verbatim, a `git status` line, a file mtime, or a `test -d` directory-absence check. No invented productivity on an empty-queue night.

**Critic attests cleanly: substantive heartbeat cycle, ship closes.**

## Files changed in this cycle AU run

- `.claude/state/wellness/engineer.json` — cycle AU update
- `.claude/state/cron/2026-05-30-overnight-run.md` — this journal (new date-stamped file)
- `docs/reports/app-health.html` — regen output (metadata-only: `generated_at` timestamp + `audit_trigger` commit-pointer; score/grade/dimensions byte-unchanged)

No code changes in cycle AU. No proposals. No FIQ writes. No bug-report state moves (inbox absent). **The v8.23.35 WIP (8 tracked src/config edits + `tests/e2e/helpers/auth.js` + emu-unified log + `.pw-*.log`) was NOT touched, staged, or committed** — it belongs to the live concurrent session and to Founder review.

# Overnight triage — 2026-05-30 (cycle AV)

**Started:** 2026-05-30T05:01:35Z (cron-fired; regen-all START)
**Finished:** 2026-05-30T05:01:49Z (regen-all "ALL DASHBOARDS REGENERATED" timestamp)
**Mode:** Heartbeat-only branch per runbook (FIQ + bug-reports inbox both absent)
**Cycle:** AV (82nd consecutive empty-inbox cycle; ~56m47s wall-clock gap from cycle AU's 04:04:48Z regen START — 36th consecutive ~1h-cadence cycle since cycle M). **Second cycle of the 2026-05-30 date** (cycle AU was the first at 04:04Z). Both the UTC clock (05:01Z) and the Founder-local clock (01:01 EDT, York PA UTC-4) agree on 2026-05-30 this cycle, so there is **no journal-date convention tension** — cycle AV section appended to this existing 2026-05-30 journal per the one-file-per-date / multi-cycle-append convention (cf. cycles S–AT all in the 2026-05-29 file).

## Inbox state at run-start (cycle AV)

- `.claude/state/founder-input-queue/` — **directory does not exist** (`test -d` → MISSING)
- `.claude/state/bug-reports/` — **entire tree absent** (no `inbox/`, no `triaged/`)
- `.claude/state/founder_input_queue.json` — **absent** (only `FIQ-` ids on disk are the FIQ-001 template examples inside `docs/FOUNDER_INPUT_QUEUE.md`, schema illustration, NOT live queue entries)
- `.claude/state/escalations/{inbox,pending}/` — empty (`.gitkeep` only)
- `.claude/state/proposals/pending/` — only `.gitkeep` (no pending proposals)
- Working tree at run-start: the same coherent uncommitted **v8.23.35 feature ship** from the **live concurrent session** carried over from cycle AU (see Blockers §1) — `M src/pages/home-rail-newuser.js`, `M src/core/firebase.js`, `M src/core/router.js`, `M src/core/utils.js`, `M src/pages/caddynotes.js`, `M index.html`, `M package.json`, `M public/sw.js`, `M tests/e2e/helpers/auth.js`, `M .gitignore` (broadened `/.pw-full-sweep.log` → `/.pw-*.log`), `M .claude/state/emu-unified-2026-05-29.log`. HEAD = `56b4c838`.

Per runbook: "If the FIQ queue + bug-reports inbox are BOTH empty: do steps 3-5 only and exit."

## Step 1 — FIQ triage (cycle AV)

- Ran end-to-end 05:01:35Z → 05:01:49Z: **=== ALL CHECKS PASSED ===**, **round-trip test PASS** (exit 0). 37th consecutive clean canonical regen-all (cycles L–AV).
- Heartbeat `regen-all-last-pass.json` written.
- Telemetry snapshot: events=16752 handoffs=1 bubbles=7 proposals_pending=0, meter_status=wired-real → HALT-25 NOT in effect. Token aggregate (all-time): real=12,536,265,566 estimated=14,505,350 manual=0.
- All ~30 guards green (round-trip 4-view swap + transcript tallies + nav 9-link + meter-wiring 7/7 + founder-queue 7/7 + quota-type-enum + cross-dash proposals_pending=0 + lifecycle proposals shipped=7 + amendments applied=28 + escalations applied=3 + theme convergence no raw hex + no-charts + protected-layouts 5/5 + 23/23 + 17 swatches + W1.S1 + proposal-readiness 0 deferred + install-scripts 7 parse + install-cmd-surface + scroll-reachability 5/0/0 + quota-status auto-derived + pause-discipline clean + wiring 5/5).
- App health: **A- (87.1)**, 1 attention item. Founder-checklist: open=6 (red=0 yellow=4 green=2) closed_total=25.
- One INFORMATIONAL `~` (not a failure): `user-context-gate` flags `main-flows.html` modified 21774.2 min after the last user-context capture (2026-05-14T23-07-48Z). Benign on a heartbeat-only night with no visual ship-close.

All 12 dimension values byte-unchanged; **overall stays 87.1 (A-)**. **The prior `generated_at` 04:09:55Z falls AFTER cycle AU's 04:04:53Z** — confirming the independent 5-min cron watcher regenerated app-health between AU and AV with the score holding flat the whole time. Not a triage-introduced change.

### 3b — Wellness refresh

- `.claude/state/wellness/engineer.json` — updated for cycle AV (counters ~1,200k tokens cumulative / 1.0h discrete-context; status `active`; thresholds_crossed=['tokens_consumed'] preserved 46th cross-cycle; full cycle-AV `_note` + `substantive_output_at_checkpoint`).
- `.claude/state/wellness/critic.json` — updated for cycle AV, bringing it current across AU+AV (cycle AU was engineer-only). Critic participated via the closing METRIC_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL 3.1 attestation + independent verbatim-diff verification. Counters ~245k tokens cumulative / 1.0h; status `active`; threshold preserved.

## Step 4 — Session journal

**This section** (cycle AV appended to the existing 2026-05-30 date journal).

## Blockers requiring Founder attention (cycle AV)

**No ship-blocking issues introduced by triage.** Awareness / carry-over items:

1. **Concurrent feature session — uncommitted v8.23.35 member-visible ship (carry-over from cycle AU; Founder decision still pending).** The dirty tree is the same coherent, version-synced, member-visible ship a concurrent interactive session was building. Contents (read from the diff hunks, not guessed):
   - **Version trio synced 8.23.34 → 8.23.35**: `package.json` `version`, `src/core/utils.js` `APP_VERSION`, `public/sw.js` `CACHE_NAME = 'parbaughs-v8.23.35'` — all consistent (Hook 5 version-sync would pass).
   - **`src/core/router.js`**: durable Firestore-backed dedup for the `profile_reminder` notification (queries existing `notifications` before sending; never re-sends). Real bug fix.
   - **`src/core/firebase.js`**: `db.settings({ experimentalForceLongPolling: true })` inside the `emulator=1` branch only — fixes Playwright webkit/headless Firestore WebChannel stalls. **Emulator-only; production keeps default detection.**
   - **`index.html`**: CSP `frame-src` directive (`'self'` + firebaseapp / googleapis / apis.google.com / gstatic + emulator auth ports) — supports the auth iframe.
   - **`src/pages/home-rail-newuser.js`**: `data-stat` / `data-count` smoke-assertion DOM hooks (P8 convention).
   - **`src/pages/caddynotes.js`**: one new member-facing "FIXED" note (profile-reminder dedup + CSP tightening + release safety-checks).
   - **`.gitignore`**: broadened `/.pw-full-sweep.log` → `/.pw-*.log` to cover the session's new `.pw-verify`/`.pw-spec06` logs.
   - **`tests/e2e/helpers/auth.js`**: modified (E2E support for the above).
   - **Founder action:** the concurrent session needs to finish E2E verification and commit this under its own `feat`/`fix` message (NOT a triage commit). **This triage cycle deliberately did NOT stage or commit any of it** — finalizing another author's unreviewed, member-visible ship would cross the runbook "DO NOT auto-anything that crosses a Founder-decision boundary" line (the caddy note changes what all 20 members see) and risk committing mid-edit/unverified work.
2. **Carry-over — `A12_operational` 60/yellow** (pipeline sub-state red). Driven by the downloads-watcher correctly skipping the live-dirty tree. Self-resolves the moment the v8.23.35 session commits (cycle AP demonstrated 60→90). NOT triage-caused, NOT a committed-code regression. **No proposal manufactured** — authoring one for a self-resolving carry-over would be ship-count gaming per METRIC_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL Rule 2.
3. **Carry-over — writer-side BOM fix (`scripts/common.ps1`) remains unauthored as a proposal.** Consumer-side `utf-8-sig` tolerance has now held 37 consecutive clean regen-all runs (cycles L–AV). Deliberately not auto-promoted without a Founder priority signal.
4. **Carry-over — journal-date convention (UTC vs Founder-local) for filename + commit date.** Not in tension this cycle (both = 2026-05-30) but unresolved as policy; Founder may want to lock which is canonical.
5. **Cron cadence** — cycles M–AV steady at ~1h. Awareness only.

## Cycle AV Critic metric-integrity attestation (per `METRIC_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL § 3.1`)

1. **"Did every bug report processed get a real diagnosis with cited evidence?"** N/A — zero bug reports tonight (inbox tree absent, verified by directory checks). Cannot wave off what doesn't exist.
2. **"Did every new proposal cite a specific screen/state/edge-case?"** N/A — zero new proposals tonight. The A12 60/yellow carry-over and the BOM fix were both deliberately *not* promoted (self-resolving / no Founder priority) rather than inflated into proposals.
3. **"Did the FIQ grades reflect rubric dimensions honestly?"** N/A — zero FIQ entries tonight. Queue absent; the only `FIQ-` ids on disk are governance-doc template examples, explicitly distinguished rather than mis-counted as triageable work.

**Heartbeat-only self-check — is tonight's substantive output real?** YES, modestly. A 37th consecutive clean canonical regen-all confirms the gate is durable. The app-health drift was inspected hunk-by-hunk AND grepped for score/status/dimension changes to *prove* it is metadata-only (clock + commit-pointer; overall flat at 87.1). The genuinely useful observation this cycle is that the prior `generated_at` 04:09:55Z post-dates cycle AU's close — proving the 5-min cron watcher regenerated app-health between AU and AV with the score holding flat — and that the v8.23.35 concurrent ship is unchanged from AU and correctly left untouched. Every claim is anchored to a quoted regen-all log line, a `git diff` hunk read verbatim, a `git status` line, or a `test -d` directory-absence check. No invented productivity on an empty-queue night.

**Critic attests cleanly: substantive heartbeat cycle, ship closes.**

## Files changed in this cycle AV run

- `.claude/state/wellness/engineer.json` — cycle AV update
- `.claude/state/wellness/critic.json` — cycle AV update (brought current across AU+AV)
- `.claude/state/cron/2026-05-30-overnight-run.md` — this journal (cycle AV section appended)

NOT staged (concurrent-session / Founder-cleared territory, via explicit pathspec): `src/pages/home-rail-newuser.js`, `src/core/firebase.js`, `src/core/router.js`, `src/core/utils.js`, `src/pages/caddynotes.js`, `index.html`, `package.json`, `public/sw.js`, `tests/e2e/helpers/auth.js`, `.gitignore`, `.claude/state/emu-unified-2026-05-29.log` — all part of the in-flight v8.23.35 feature session left for Founder review.

No code changes in cycle AV. No proposals. No FIQ writes. No bug-report state moves (inbox absent). app-health overall FLAT at 87.1 (A-).

# Overnight triage — 2026-05-30 (cycle AW)

**Started:** 2026-05-30T06:01:32Z (cron-fired; regen-all START)
**Finished:** 2026-05-30T06:01:37Z (regen-all "ALL DASHBOARDS REGENERATED" timestamp)
**Mode:** Heartbeat-only branch per runbook (FIQ + bug-reports inbox both absent)
**Cycle:** AW (83rd consecutive empty-inbox cycle; ~59m57s wall-clock gap from cycle AV's 05:01:35Z regen START — 37th consecutive ~1h-cadence cycle since cycle M). **Third cycle of the 2026-05-30 date** (AU first at 04:04Z, AV second at 05:01Z). Both the UTC clock (06:01Z) and the Founder-local clock (02:01 EDT, York PA UTC-4) agree on 2026-05-30 this cycle, so there is **no journal-date convention tension** — cycle AW section appended to this existing 2026-05-30 journal per the one-file-per-date / multi-cycle-append convention.

## Inbox state at run-start (cycle AW)

- `.claude/state/founder-input-queue/` — **directory does not exist** (`test -d` → MISSING)
- `.claude/state/bug-reports/` — **entire tree absent** (no `inbox/`, no `triaged/`)
- `.claude/state/aggregates/fiq-status.json` — present, but this is the **Firestore Index Queue** (26 declared / 26 deployed, source `firestore.indexes.json`) — an **acronym collision**, NOT the Founder Input Queue. Explicitly distinguished, not mis-counted as triageable work.
- `.claude/state/proposals/pending/` — only `.gitkeep` (no pending proposals)
- Working tree at run-start: **near-clean**. The v8.23.35/v8.23.36 ship that cycles AU+AV carried as dirty is **now committed** — HEAD chain `7b0cb3bc` ("fix: durable profile_reminder dedup … v8.23.35") → `4dce966b` ("feat: trophy-room earned-achievement medallions … v8.23.36") → `ef352dce` ("cron(routine): post-commit dashboard regen …"). Only one non-self dirty path at run-start: `M .claude/state/emu-unified-2026-05-29.log` (a concurrent emulator session's log). HEAD = `ef352dce`.

Per runbook: "If the FIQ queue + bug-reports inbox are BOTH empty: do steps 3-5 only and exit."

## Step 1 — FIQ triage (cycle AW)

- FIQ entries triaged: **0** (queue directory + json store both absent; the only `FIQ-` file on disk is the Firestore-Index `fiq-status.json` acronym collision)
- Grade breakdown: N/A — A:0 B:0 C:0 D:0 F:0
- IDs: none

## Step 2 — Bug-report triage (cycle AW)

- Bug reports processed: **0** (inbox tree absent)
- Dispositions: none
- No P3e discussion bubbles opened (nothing to deliberate)

## Step 3 — Heartbeat (cycle AW)

### 3a — `scripts/regen-all.ps1`

- Ran end-to-end 06:01:32Z → 06:01:37Z: **=== ALL CHECKS PASSED ===**, **round-trip test PASS** (exit 0). 38th consecutive clean canonical regen-all (cycles L–AW).
- Heartbeat `regen-all-last-pass.json` written.
- Telemetry snapshot: events=16809 handoffs=1 bubbles=7 proposals_pending=0, meter_status=wired-real → HALT-25 NOT in effect. Token aggregate (all-time): real=12,579,455,709 estimated=14,581,400 manual=0.
- All ~30 guards green (round-trip 4-view swap + transcript tallies 3 bubbles + nav 9-link ×9 + meter-wiring 7/7 + founder-queue 7/7 + quota-type-enum + cross-dash proposals_pending=0 + lifecycle proposals shipped=7 + amendments applied=28 + escalations applied=3 + theme convergence no raw hex + no-charts + protected-layouts 5/5 + 23/23 + 17 swatches + W1.S1 + proposal-readiness 0 deferred + install-scripts 7 parse + install-cmd-surface + scroll-reachability 5/0/0 + quota-status auto-derived + pause-discipline clean + wiring 5/5).
- App health: **A- (87.1)**, 1 attention item. Founder-checklist: open=6 (red=0 yellow=4 green=2) closed_total=25.
- One INFORMATIONAL `~` (not a failure): `user-context-gate` flags `main-flows.html` modified 21834.0 min after the last user-context capture (2026-05-14T23-07-48Z). Benign on a heartbeat-only night with no visual ship-close.

**Working-tree diff after regen — `docs/reports/app-health.html` is PURELY metadata.** Proven by reading the diff verbatim AND grepping it for `overall_score` / `overall_grade` / `score` / `status` / `pre_deduction` / `post_deduction` / `dimension` changes (returns EMPTY). The only `+/-` lines are: (a) `generated_at` 2026-05-30T05:52:07Z → 06:01:36Z, and (b) `audit_trigger` commit-pointer re-pointing `sha` `4dce966b` ("feat: trophy-room earned-achievement medallions … v8.23.36", trigger=app-commit, app_files_touched 5) → `ef352dce` ("cron(routine): post-commit dashboard regen …", trigger=cron, app_files_touched [], `total_files_touched` 7→4). All 12 dimension values byte-unchanged; **overall stays 87.1 (A-)**. **The prior `generated_at` 05:52:07Z falls AFTER cycle AV's 05:01:48Z** — confirming the independent 5-min cron watcher regenerated app-health between AV and AW with the score holding flat the whole time. Not a triage-introduced change.

### 3b — Wellness refresh

- `.claude/state/wellness/engineer.json` — updated for cycle AW (counters ~1,250k tokens cumulative / 1.0h discrete-context; status `active`; thresholds_crossed=['tokens_consumed'] preserved 47th cross-cycle; full cycle-AW `_note` + `substantive_output_at_checkpoint`).
- `.claude/state/wellness/critic.json` — updated for cycle AW. Critic participated via the closing METRIC_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL 3.1 attestation + independent verbatim-diff verification. Counters ~255k tokens cumulative / 1.0h; status `active`; threshold preserved.

## Step 4 — Session journal

**This section** (cycle AW appended to the existing 2026-05-30 date journal).

## Cycle AW counts

| Metric | Count |
|---|---|
| FIQ entries triaged | 0 |
| Bug reports processed | 0 |
| New proposals authored | 0 |
| Wellness state changes | 2 (engineer.json + critic.json cycle AW refresh) |

## Blockers requiring Founder attention (cycle AW)

**No ship-blocking issues introduced by triage.** Awareness / carry-over items:

1. **v8.23.35/v8.23.36 ship now COMMITTED — carry-over §1 from AU+AV is RESOLVED.** The coherent member-visible ship the concurrent session was building is committed under its own messages (`7b0cb3bc` v8.23.35 fix, `4dce966b` v8.23.36 feat). No other-author WIP to refuse this cycle. Founder review of those two commits is the only remaining loop, and that is normal post-commit review, not a triage blocker.
2. **`A12_operational`** — expected to recover toward green now the v8.23.x ship has committed (cf. cycle AP 60→90 precedent the instant the dirty tree cleared). The lingering `open=6` founder-checklist count is residual concurrent-ship drift; red=0, nothing ship-blocking. **No proposal manufactured** — authoring one for a self-resolving condition would be ship-count gaming per METRIC_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL Rule 2.
3. **Carry-over — concurrent emulator log `.claude/state/emu-unified-2026-05-29.log`** is dirty (a live emulator session's territory). Deliberately **not staged** this cycle.
4. **Carry-over — writer-side BOM fix (`scripts/common.ps1`) remains unauthored as a proposal.** Consumer-side `utf-8-sig` tolerance has now held 38 consecutive clean regen-all runs (cycles L–AW). Deliberately not auto-promoted without a Founder priority signal.
5. **Carry-over — journal-date convention (UTC vs Founder-local) for filename + commit date.** Not in tension this cycle (both = 2026-05-30) but unresolved as policy; Founder may want to lock which is canonical.
6. **Cron cadence** — cycles M–AW steady at ~1h. Awareness only.

## Cycle AW Critic metric-integrity attestation (per `METRIC_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL § 3.1`)

1. **"Did every bug report processed get a real diagnosis with cited evidence?"** N/A — zero bug reports tonight (inbox tree absent, verified by directory checks). Cannot wave off what doesn't exist.
2. **"Did every new proposal cite a specific screen/state/edge-case?"** N/A — zero new proposals tonight. The A12 recovery and the BOM fix were both deliberately *not* promoted (self-resolving / no Founder priority) rather than inflated into proposals.
3. **"Did the FIQ grades reflect rubric dimensions honestly?"** N/A — zero FIQ entries tonight. Queue absent; the only `FIQ-` id on disk is `fiq-status.json` (Firestore Index queue), explicitly distinguished as an acronym collision rather than mis-counted as triageable work.

**Heartbeat-only self-check — is tonight's substantive output real?** YES, modestly. A 38th consecutive clean canonical regen-all confirms the gate is durable. The app-health drift was inspected hunk-by-hunk AND grepped for score/status/dimension changes to *prove* it is metadata-only (clock + commit-pointer; overall flat at 87.1). The genuinely useful observations this cycle: (a) the prior `generated_at` 05:52:07Z post-dates cycle AV's close — proving the 5-min cron watcher regenerated app-health between AV and AW with the score holding flat — and (b) the AU/AV carry-over §1 (uncommitted v8.23.35 ship) is now genuinely RESOLVED by two real commits, so the tree is near-clean and there is no longer another author's WIP to refuse. Every claim is anchored to a quoted regen-all log line, a `git diff` hunk read verbatim, a `git log`/`git status` line, or a `test -d` directory-absence check. No invented productivity on an empty-queue night.

**Critic attests cleanly: substantive heartbeat cycle, ship closes.**

## Files changed in this cycle AW run

NOT staged (concurrent-session territory, via explicit pathspec): `.claude/state/emu-unified-2026-05-29.log` — a live emulator session's log, left for that session / Founder.

No code changes in cycle AW. No proposals. No FIQ writes. No bug-report state moves (inbox absent). app-health overall FLAT at 87.1 (A-).

# Cycle AX — overnight triage (2026-05-30, 4th cycle of date)

**Branch decision: inbox empty; heartbeat only.** FIQ + bug-reports inbox both ABSENT for the 84th consecutive cycle — verified directly this cycle (not echoed from AW): `.claude/state/founder-input-queue/` does not exist; `.claude/state/bug-reports/` tree (no `inbox/`, no `triaged/`) does not exist; `proposals/pending/` holds only `.gitkeep`. The only `FIQ-` id on disk is `.claude/state/aggregates/fiq-status.json`, whose header reads `schema_version: "fiq-status-v1.0"` (a **Firestore Index** status file, `generated_at` 2026-05-29T08:32:15Z, `head_sha` edefa54a) — an acronym collision, **not** the Founder Input Queue. Per runbook "BOTH empty → steps 3-5 only."

## Step 3 — Heartbeat (cycle AX)

### 3a — `scripts/regen-all.ps1`

- Ran end-to-end 07:00:48Z → 07:00:53Z: **=== ALL CHECKS PASSED ===**, **round-trip test PASS** (exit 0). 39th consecutive clean canonical regen-all (cycles L–AX).

**Working-tree diff after regen — `docs/reports/app-health.html` is PURELY metadata (4 ins / 4 del).** Proven by reading the diff verbatim AND grepping it for `overall_score` / `overall_grade` / `score` / `status` / `pre_deduction` / `post_deduction` / `dimension` changes (returns EMPTY). The only `+/-` lines are: (a) `generated_at` 2026-05-30T06:57:10.911240Z → 07:00:52.944315Z, and (b) `audit_trigger` commit-pointer re-pointing `sha` `1f1e4f02` (`committed_at` 02:56:56-04:00, `total_files_touched` 4) → `ff82b682` (`committed_at` 02:58:13-04:00, `total_files_touched` 2) — and `git log` confirms BOTH `1f1e4f02` and `ff82b682` are *"cron(routine): post-commit dashboard regen (AMD-019 + AMD-020 Class A auto-clean)"* commits. All 12 dimension values byte-unchanged; **overall stays 87.1 (A-)**. The prior `generated_at` 06:57:10Z falls AFTER cycle AW's regen close (06:01:37Z) — confirming the independent 5-min cron watcher regenerated app-health between AW and AX with the score holding flat. Not a triage-introduced change.

### 3b — Wellness refresh

- `.claude/state/wellness/engineer.json` — updated for cycle AX (counters ~1,260k tokens cumulative / 1.0h discrete-context; status `active`; thresholds_crossed=['tokens_consumed'] preserved 48th cross-cycle; full cycle-AX `_note` + `substantive_output_at_checkpoint`).

## Blockers requiring Founder attention (cycle AX)

**No ship-blocking issues introduced by triage.** Awareness / carry-over items:

1. **Concurrent session advanced to v8.23.39.** Untracked `mobile-home-8.23.39.png` + `prodbundle-home-firstload-8.23.39.png` (plus an `.claude/state/overnight-agent/reports/2026-05-30.md` and a `stop-decisions/2026-05-30.ndjson`) show the concurrent session moved past the v8.23.36 state AW described. These are **not our WIP** — left untouched and unstaged. Founder review of those commits/artifacts is normal post-commit review, not a triage blocker.
2. **`A12_operational` / founder-checklist `open=6`** — residual concurrent-ship drift (red=0 yellow=4 green=2 closed=25); red=0 so nothing ship-blocking. **No proposal manufactured** — authoring one for a self-resolving condition would be ship-count gaming per METRIC_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL Rule 2.

# Cycle AY — overnight triage (2026-05-30, 5th cycle of date)

**Branch decision: inbox empty; heartbeat only.** FIQ + bug-reports inbox both ABSENT for the 85th consecutive cycle — verified directly this cycle (not echoed from AX): `.claude/state/founder-input-queue/` does not exist (`test -d` → MISSING); `.claude/state/bug-reports/` tree (no `inbox/`, no `triaged/`) does not exist; `proposals/pending/` holds only `.gitkeep` (0 real proposals). Per runbook "BOTH empty → steps 3-5 only."

**Cadence:** Cycle AX opened regen START 07:00:48Z; cycle AY opens 08:01:13Z = ~60m25s wall-clock gap — **39th consecutive ~1h-cadence cycle** since cycle M. Both the UTC clock (08:01Z) and the Founder-local clock (04:01 EDT, York PA UTC-4) agree on 2026-05-30, so **no journal-date convention tension** — cycle AY appended to the existing 2026-05-30 date journal per the multi-cycle-per-date convention (AU+AV+AW+AX already in this file).

## Step 1 — FIQ triage (cycle AY)

- FIQ entries triaged: **0** (queue directory absent)
- Grade breakdown: N/A — A:0 B:0 C:0 D:0 F:0

## Step 2 — Bug-report triage (cycle AY)

- Bug reports processed: **0** (inbox tree absent)

### 3a — `scripts/regen-all.ps1`

- Ran end-to-end 08:01:13Z → 08:01:19Z: **=== ALL CHECKS PASSED ===**, **round-trip test PASS**. 40th consecutive clean canonical regen-all (cycles L–AY).
- Heartbeat `regen-all-last-pass.json` written.

All 12 dimension values byte-unchanged; **overall stays 87.1 (A-)**. The prior `generated_at` 07:56:45Z falls AFTER cycle AX's regen close (07:00:53Z) and BEFORE cycle AY's 08:01:13Z START — confirming the independent 5-min cron watcher regenerated app-health between AX and AY with the score holding flat (pointing `audit_trigger` at the v8.23.43 fix `fdcc124c`); cycle AY's regen then re-points it forward to the cron-regen HEAD `3d211a99`. Not a triage-introduced change.

## Blockers requiring Founder attention (cycle AY)

**No ship-blocking issues introduced by triage.** Awareness / carry-over items:

1. **Concurrent session advanced to v8.23.43.** Untracked `verify-v8.23.43-livescoring-header.png` plus the committed `fdcc124c` *"fix(v8.23.43): single source of truth for round format labels"* show the concurrent session moved past the v8.23.39 state AX described (the v8.23.39 PNGs are now committed/gone). Plus `.claude/state/overnight-agent/reports/2026-05-30.md` and `.claude/state/stop-decisions/2026-05-30.ndjson` remain untracked other-tooling artifacts. These are **not our WIP** — left untouched and unstaged. Founder review of those commits/artifacts is normal post-commit review, not a triage blocker.
2. **`A12_operational` / founder-checklist `open=6`** — residual concurrent-ship drift (red=0 yellow=4 green=2 closed=25); red=0 so nothing ship-blocking. **No proposal manufactured** — authoring one for a self-resolving condition would be ship-count gaming per METRIC_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL Rule 2.
3. **Carry-over — concurrent emulator log `.claude/state/emu-unified-2026-05-29.log`** is dirty (a live emulator session's territory). Deliberately **not staged**.
4. **Carry-over — writer-side BOM fix (`scripts/common.ps1`) remains unauthored as a proposal.** Consumer-side `utf-8-sig` tolerance has now held 40 consecutive clean regen-all runs (cycles L–AY). Deliberately not auto-promoted without a Founder priority signal.
5. **Carry-over — journal-date convention (UTC vs Founder-local) for filename + commit date.** Not in tension this cycle (both = 2026-05-30) but unresolved as policy; Founder may want to lock which is canonical.
6. **Cron cadence** — cycles M–AY steady at ~1h (39 consecutive). Awareness only.

## Cycle AY Critic metric-integrity attestation (per `METRIC_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL § 3.1`)

1. **"Did every bug report processed get a real diagnosis with cited evidence?"** N/A — zero bug reports tonight (inbox tree absent, verified by directory checks this cycle). Cannot wave off what doesn't exist.
2. **"Did every new proposal cite a specific screen/state/edge-case?"** N/A — zero new proposals tonight. The founder-checklist drift and the BOM fix were both deliberately *not* promoted (self-resolving concurrent-ship territory / no Founder priority) rather than inflated into proposals.
3. **"Did the FIQ grades reflect rubric dimensions honestly?"** N/A — zero FIQ entries tonight. Queue absent.

**Heartbeat-only self-check — is tonight's substantive output real?** YES, modestly. A 40th consecutive clean canonical regen-all confirms the gate is durable. The app-health drift was inspected hunk-by-hunk AND grepped for score/status/dimension changes to *prove* it is metadata-only (clock + commit-pointer; overall flat at 87.1). The genuinely useful observation this cycle: the prior `generated_at` 07:56:45Z post-dates cycle AX's close (07:00:53Z) and pre-dates AY's START (08:01:13Z) — proving the 5-min cron watcher regenerated app-health between AX and AY with the score holding flat, transiently pointing `audit_trigger` at the v8.23.43 fix before AY re-points it to the cron-regen HEAD. Every claim is anchored to a quoted regen-all log line, a `git diff` hunk read verbatim, a `git log`/`git status` line, or a `test -d` directory-absence check. No invented productivity on an empty-queue night.

# Cycle AZ — overnight triage (2026-05-30, 6th cycle of date)

**Branch decision: inbox empty; heartbeat only.** FIQ + bug-reports inbox both ABSENT for the **86th consecutive cycle** — verified directly this cycle (not echoed from AY): `.claude/state/founder-input-queue/` does not exist; `.claude/state/bug-reports/` tree (no `inbox/`, no `triaged/`) does not exist; `proposals/pending/` holds only `.gitkeep` (0 real proposals). The only `FIQ-` id on disk is `.claude/state/aggregates/fiq-status.json` (a **Firestore Index** status file — acronym collision, **not** the Founder Input Queue). Per runbook "BOTH empty → steps 3-5 only."

**Cadence:** Cycle AY opened regen START 08:01:13Z; cycle AZ opens 09:01:07Z = ~59m54s wall-clock gap — **40th consecutive ~1h-cadence cycle** since cycle M. Both the UTC clock (09:01Z) and the Founder-local clock (05:01 EDT, York PA UTC-4) agree on 2026-05-30, so **no journal-date convention tension** — cycle AZ appended to the existing 2026-05-30 date journal per the multi-cycle-per-date convention (AU+AV+AW+AX+AY already in this file).

## Step 1 — FIQ triage (cycle AZ)

- FIQ entries triaged: **0** (queue directory absent)
- Grade breakdown: N/A — A:0 B:0 C:0 D:0 F:0
- IDs: none

## Step 2 — Bug-report triage (cycle AZ)

- Bug reports processed: **0** (inbox tree absent)
- Dispositions: none
- No P3e discussion bubbles opened (nothing to deliberate)

## Step 3 — Heartbeat (cycle AZ)

### 3a — `scripts/regen-all.ps1`

- Ran end-to-end 09:01:07Z → 09:01:12Z: **=== ALL CHECKS PASSED ===**, **round-trip test PASS**. 41st consecutive clean canonical regen-all (cycles L–AZ).
- Heartbeat `regen-all-last-pass.json` written.
- Telemetry snapshot: events=17000 handoffs=1 bubbles=7 proposals_pending=0, meter_status=wired-real → HALT-25 NOT in effect. Token aggregate (all-time): real=12,767,214,199 estimated=14,773,280 manual=0.
- All ~30 guards green (round-trip 4-view swap + transcript tallies 3 bubbles + nav 9-link ×9 + meter-wiring 7/7 + founder-queue 7/7 + quota-type-enum + cross-dash proposals_pending=0 + lifecycle proposals shipped=7 + amendments applied=28 + escalations applied=3 + theme convergence no raw hex + no-charts + protected-layouts 5/5 + 23/23 + 17 swatches + W1.S1 + proposal-readiness 0 deferred + install-scripts 7 parse + install-cmd-surface + scroll-reachability 5/0/0 + quota-status auto-derived + pause-discipline clean + wiring 5/5).
- App health: **A- (87.1)**, 1 attention item. Founder-checklist: open=6 (red=0 yellow=4 green=2) closed_total=25.
- One INFORMATIONAL `~` (not a failure): `user-context-gate` flags `main-flows.html` modified 22013.6 min after the last user-context capture (2026-05-14T23-07-48Z). Benign on a heartbeat-only night.

**Working-tree diff after regen — `docs/reports/app-health.html` is NOT purely metadata this cycle (honesty delta from AU–AY).** Read verbatim, the diff has **three** distinct change classes:
1. **(metadata)** `generated_at` 2026-05-30T08:46:20.453278Z → 09:01:11.961184Z.
2. **(REAL content change)** `src/pages/members-detail.js` line-count **822 → 842** (budget 800) — appears in BOTH the architecture-dimension weak_point `what` string *and* the file-budget sub-block. This reflects the **live concurrent session actively editing `members-detail.js`** (`M src/pages/members-detail.js` was dirty at run-start; the file is genuinely 842 lines now).
3. **(commit-pointer)** `audit_trigger` re-pointed `sha` `222ec35f` (*"fix: par-relative, community-safe score on round detail + share card (v8.23.46)"*, `committed_at` 2026-05-30T04:45:57-04:00, `trigger`=app-commit, `is_app_commit` true, 5 `app_files_touched` [`public/sw.js`, `src/core/router-sharecard.js`, `src/core/utils.js`, `src/pages/caddynotes.js`, `src/pages/rounds.js`], `total_files_touched` 6) → `6c70516c` (*"cron(routine): post-commit dashboard regen (AMD-019 + AMD-020 Class A auto-clean)"*, `committed_at` 2026-05-30T04:47:24-04:00, `trigger`=cron, `is_app_commit` false, `app_files_touched` [], `total_files_touched` 4).

**Despite the `members-detail.js` growth, `overall_score` stays 87.1 (A-), `overall_grade` A-, and all 12 dimension SCORES are byte-unchanged.** Verified by grepping the diff: the only changed numeric lines are the two `members-detail.js` line-count details (`822`→`842`), which are weak_point *detail* text, not score lines. The architecture score holds because `members-detail.js` was **already** over the 800-line AMD-027 budget at 822, so growing to 842 stays within the same already-penalized over-budget state and does not move the dimension score. This cycle did **not** claim "purely metadata" — the 822→842 delta is a real, concurrent-session-driven content change surfaced honestly.

### 3b — Wellness refresh

- `.claude/state/wellness/engineer.json` — updated for cycle AZ (counters ~1,300k tokens cumulative / 1.0h discrete-context; status `active`; thresholds_crossed=['tokens_consumed'] preserved 50th cross-cycle; full cycle-AZ `_note` + `substantive_output_at_checkpoint` incl. the not-purely-metadata honesty delta).
- `.claude/state/wellness/critic.json` — updated for cycle AZ. Critic participated via the closing METRIC_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL 3.1 attestation + independent verbatim-diff verification, specifically catching that the diff was NOT purely metadata and refusing to echo prior-cycle boilerplate. Counters ~285k tokens cumulative / 1.0h; status `active`; threshold preserved.

## Step 4 — Session journal

**This section** (cycle AZ appended to the existing 2026-05-30 date journal).

## Cycle AZ counts

| Metric | Count |
|---|---|
| FIQ entries triaged | 0 (queue absent) |
| Bug reports processed | 0 (inbox absent) |
| New proposals authored | 0 |
| Wellness state changes | 2 (engineer.json + critic.json cycle AZ refresh) |

FIQ grade distribution: A=0 B=0 C=0 D=0 F=0 (no entries graded — queue absent).

## Blockers requiring Founder attention (cycle AZ)

**No ship-blocking issues introduced by triage.** Awareness / carry-over items:

1. **Concurrent session is editing LIVE and advanced to v8.23.46.** The system-reminder run-start snapshot showed only `M src/pages/members-detail.js` + `M emu-unified-2026-05-29.log`, but by mid-cycle `M src/core/router-sharecard.js` + `M src/pages/courses-detail.js` + `M src/pages/scramble.js` had ALSO appeared — proving live concurrent edits *during* this cycle. `git log` shows the concurrent session shipped **v8.23.45** (`04349d04`) + **v8.23.46** (`222ec35f`) since cycle AY (which was at v8.23.43), with cron-regen commits interleaved; HEAD = `6c70516c`. These are **not our WIP** — left untouched and unstaged. Founder review of those commits is normal post-commit review, not a triage blocker.
2. **`src/pages/members-detail.js` is over the AMD-027 800-line budget (now 842, up from 822).** This is an **existing** architecture weak_point, not triage-caused, and the concurrent session is *actively editing the file right now*. **No proposal manufactured** — authoring an AMD-027 split proposal for a file another author is mid-edit on would be both ship-count gaming (Rule 2) and a collision risk; the split should be the concurrent author's / Founder's call once that ship settles.
3. **`A12_operational` / founder-checklist `open=6`** — residual concurrent-ship drift (red=0 yellow=4 green=2 closed=25); red=0 so nothing ship-blocking.
4. **Carry-over — concurrent emulator log `.claude/state/emu-unified-2026-05-29.log`** is dirty (a live emulator session's territory). Deliberately **not staged**.
5. **Carry-over — writer-side BOM fix (`scripts/common.ps1`) remains unauthored as a proposal.** Consumer-side `utf-8-sig` tolerance has now held 41 consecutive clean regen-all runs (cycles L–AZ). Deliberately not auto-promoted without a Founder priority signal.
6. **Carry-over — journal-date convention (UTC vs Founder-local) for filename + commit date.** Not in tension this cycle (both = 2026-05-30) but unresolved as policy; Founder may want to lock which is canonical.
7. **Cron cadence** — cycles M–AZ steady at ~1h (40 consecutive). Awareness only.

## Cycle AZ Critic metric-integrity attestation (per `METRIC_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL § 3.1`)

1. **"Did every bug report processed get a real diagnosis with cited evidence?"** N/A — zero bug reports tonight (inbox tree absent, verified by directory checks this cycle). Cannot wave off what doesn't exist.
2. **"Did every new proposal cite a specific screen/state/edge-case?"** N/A — zero new proposals tonight. The `members-detail.js` over-budget (an existing AMD-027 weak_point the concurrent session is actively editing) and the BOM fix were both deliberately *not* promoted rather than inflated into proposals.
3. **"Did the FIQ grades reflect rubric dimensions honestly?"** N/A — zero FIQ entries tonight. Queue absent.

**Heartbeat-only self-check — is tonight's substantive output real?** YES, and this cycle the integrity discipline was *sharper than boilerplate*. A 41st consecutive clean canonical regen-all confirms the gate is durable. Critically, this cycle the app-health diff was **NOT** purely metadata (unlike AU–AY), and rather than echo the prior cycles' "purely metadata" language, the diff was read verbatim and the **real** `members-detail.js` 822→842 weak_point growth was surfaced — *with* the honest explanation of why the overall score still holds at 87.1 (the file was already over the 800 budget, so further growth doesn't move the architecture dimension score). Every claim is anchored to a quoted regen-all log line, a `git diff` hunk read verbatim, a `git log`/`git status` line, or a `test -d` directory-absence check. No invented productivity, and no lazy boilerplate where the facts diverged.

**Critic attests cleanly: substantive heartbeat cycle, honest diff characterization (not-purely-metadata caught), ship closes.**

## Files changed in this cycle AZ run

- `.claude/state/wellness/engineer.json` — cycle AZ update
- `.claude/state/wellness/critic.json` — cycle AZ update
- `.claude/state/cron/2026-05-30-overnight-run.md` — this journal (cycle AZ section appended)
- `docs/reports/app-health.html` — regen output (metadata `generated_at` + `audit_trigger` commit-pointer `222ec35f`→`6c70516c` + **real** `members-detail.js` 822→842 weak_point detail; overall score/grade + all 12 dimension scores byte-unchanged at 87.1 A-)

NOT staged (live concurrent-session / other-tooling territory, via explicit pathspec): `.claude/state/emu-unified-2026-05-29.log`, `src/pages/members-detail.js`, `src/core/router-sharecard.js`, `src/pages/courses-detail.js`, `src/pages/scramble.js`, `.claude/state/overnight-agent/reports/2026-05-30.md`, `.claude/state/stop-decisions/2026-05-30.ndjson`.

No code changes in cycle AZ. No proposals. No FIQ writes. No bug-report state moves (inbox absent). app-health overall FLAT at 87.1 (A-), with a real (non-score-moving) `members-detail.js` weak_point line-count delta honestly surfaced.

# Cycle BA — overnight triage (SEVENTH cycle of 2026-05-30)

**Regen START** `2026-05-30T10:02:05Z` (= 06:02 EDT, York PA UTC-4 — both clocks agree on 2026-05-30, no journal-date tension). **~1h01m** after cycle AZ (09:01:07Z) — **41st consecutive ~1h-cadence cycle** since cycle M. **87th consecutive empty-inbox cycle.**

## Triage scope — BOTH queues ABSENT (heartbeat-only branch)

Verified by my own directory/file checks THIS cycle (not echoed):

- `.claude/state/founder_input_queue.json` — **MISSING**
- `.claude/state/founder-input-queue/` (dir) — **MISSING**
- `.claude/state/bug-reports/` tree — **MISSING** (no `inbox/`, no `triaged/`)
- `.claude/state/proactive-backlog.md` — **MISSING**
- `.claude/state/proposals/pending/` — only `.gitkeep` (0 real proposals)

The only `fiq`/`FIQ` artifact on disk is `.claude/state/aggregates/fiq-status.json` — a **Firestore Index** status file (acronym collision), **NOT** the Founder Input Queue. Per the runbook fallback ("FIQ queue + bug-reports inbox BOTH empty → do steps 3–5 only"), this is a **heartbeat-only** cycle.

## Step 3a — `scripts/regen-all.ps1` (gating wrapper)

Ran end-to-end `10:02:05Z` → `ALL DASHBOARDS REGENERATED at 2026-05-30T10:02:11Z`, `=== ALL CHECKS PASSED ===`, round-trip test **PASS**. Heartbeat `regen-all-last-pass.json` written. **42nd consecutive clean canonical regen-all** (cycles L–BA).

All ~30 guards green: round-trip 4-view swap; transcript tallies (3 bubbles); nav 9-link ×9; meter-wiring 7/7; founder-queue 7/7; quota-type-enum; cross-dash `proposals_pending=0`; lifecycle proposals `shipped=7`; amendments `applied=28`; escalations `applied=3`; theme convergence (no raw hex); no-charts; protected-layouts 5/5 + 23/23; 17 swatches; W1.S1; proposal-readiness 0 deferred; install-scripts 7 parse; install-cmd-surface; scroll-reachability 5/0/0; quota-status auto-derived; pause-discipline clean; wiring 5/5.

Telemetry: `events=17063 handoffs=1 bubbles=7 proposals_pending=0`, `meter_status=wired-real` → **HALT-25 NOT in effect**. Token aggregate (all-time): `real=12,827,461,716 estimated=14,844,780 manual=0`.

One **informational** `~` (not a failure): user-context-gate flags `main-flows.html` modified 22074.6 min after last user-context capture (2026-05-14T23-07-48Z) — benign on a heartbeat-only night.

### app-health diff — HONEST: purely metadata this cycle

Unlike cycle AZ (which carried a real `members-detail.js` 822→842 weak_point growth), cycle BA's `docs/reports/app-health.html` diff is **purely metadata** — verified by reading the full `git diff` verbatim. Exactly two hunks:

1. `generated_at` `2026-05-30T09:53:02.313608Z` → `10:02:10.719129Z`
2. `audit_trigger` pointer re-pointed: `397ef201` (*"fix: base-prefix emitted deferred bundle src so staging serves it as JS (v8.23.50)"*, `trigger=app-commit`, `is_app_commit=true`, `app_files_touched=[public/sw.js, src/core/utils.js]`, 4 files) → `8a436a40` (*"cron(routine): post-commit dashboard regen (AMD-019 + AMD-020 Class A auto-clean)"*, `trigger=cron`, `is_app_commit=false`, `app_files_touched=[]`, 4 files)

`overall_score` stays **87.1 (A-)**, `overall_grade` A-, and **all 12 dimension scores byte-unchanged**. `members-detail.js` reads 842 lines but that is unchanged from AZ's committed baseline — the concurrent session **committed** its members-detail.js edits since AZ (HEAD `6c70516c` → `8a436a40`, v8.23.43 → v8.23.50), so the diffed baseline already carried 842 and there is **no new weak_point delta**. I am stating metadata-only plainly because the full-diff read confirms it — no manufactured "catch" in either direction.

## Step 3b — Wellness refresh

- `.claude/state/wellness/engineer.json` — updated for cycle BA (counters ~1,300k tokens cumulative / 1.0h discrete-context; status `active`; `thresholds_crossed=['tokens_consumed']` preserved 51st cross-cycle; full cycle-BA `_note` + `substantive_output_at_checkpoint`).
- `.claude/state/wellness/critic.json` — updated for cycle BA. Critic participated via the closing METRIC_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL 3.1 attestation + independent verbatim full-diff verification, this cycle confirming the diff genuinely IS metadata-only (the inverse call to AZ) and refusing to reflexively echo AZ's "not purely metadata" framing. Counters ~295k tokens cumulative / 1.0h; status `active`; threshold preserved.

## Step 4 — Session journal

FIQ grade distribution: A=0 B=0 C=0 D=0 F=0 (no entries graded — queue absent).

## Blockers requiring Founder attention (cycle BA)

**No ship-blocking issues introduced by triage.** Awareness / carry-over items:

1. **Concurrent base-prefix session is editing LIVE and has shipped v8.23.43 → v8.23.50.** Since cycle AZ (HEAD `6c70516c`), the concurrent session committed through `8a436a40` (current HEAD), including v8.23.48–50 base-prefix / deferred-bundle fixes. During THIS cycle `M index.html` appeared at the repo root — the app entry templatized with `%BASE_URL%` asset paths (e.g. `%BASE_URL%watermark.jpg`, `%BASE_URL%manifest.json`). This is the concurrent session's WIP, **not** a heartbeat side-effect: `regen-index.py` writes `docs/reports/index.html`, **not** the root `index.html`. Left untouched/unstaged. Founder review of those commits is normal post-commit review, not a triage blocker.
2. **`src/pages/members-detail.js` remains over the AMD-027 800-line budget (842).** Existing architecture weak_point, **not** triage-caused; the concurrent session just committed work on this file. **No proposal manufactured** — authoring an AMD-027 split proposal for a file another author is actively shipping would be both ship-count gaming (Rule 2) and a collision risk; the split is the concurrent author's / Founder's call.
3. **`A12_operational` / founder-checklist `open=6`** — residual concurrent-ship drift (red=0 yellow=4 green=2 closed=25); red=0 so nothing ship-blocking.
4. **Carry-over — concurrent emulator log `.claude/state/emu-unified-2026-05-29.log`** is dirty (a live emulator session's territory). Deliberately **not staged**.
5. **Carry-over — untracked verify artifacts** at repo root: seven `verify-*.png` screenshots (a concurrent verify session's output) + `.claude/state/overnight-agent/reports/2026-05-30.md` + `.claude/state/stop-decisions/2026-05-30.ndjson`. Deliberately **not staged** (other-tooling territory).
6. **Carry-over — writer-side BOM fix (`scripts/common.ps1`)** remains unauthored as a proposal. Consumer-side `utf-8-sig` tolerance has held 42 consecutive clean regen-all runs (cycles L–BA). Deliberately not auto-promoted without a Founder priority signal.
7. **Carry-over — journal-date convention (UTC vs Founder-local)** for filename + commit date. Not in tension this cycle (both = 2026-05-30) but unresolved as policy; Founder may want to lock which is canonical.
8. **Cron cadence** — cycles M–BA steady at ~1h (41 consecutive). Awareness only.

## Cycle BA Critic metric-integrity attestation (per `METRIC_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL § 3.1`)

1. **"Did every bug report processed get a real diagnosis with cited evidence?"** N/A — zero bug reports tonight (inbox tree absent, verified by directory checks this cycle). Cannot wave off what doesn't exist.
2. **"Did every new proposal cite a specific screen/state/edge-case?"** N/A — zero new proposals tonight. The `members-detail.js` over-budget (an existing AMD-027 weak_point the concurrent session just committed work on) and the BOM fix were both deliberately *not* promoted rather than inflated into proposals.
3. **"Did the FIQ grades reflect rubric dimensions honestly?"** N/A — zero FIQ entries tonight. Queue absent.

**Heartbeat-only self-check — is tonight's substantive output real?** YES. A 42nd consecutive clean canonical regen-all confirms the gate is durable. This cycle the integrity discipline was the *inverse* of AZ: the risk was reflexively repeating AZ's "not purely metadata" language, so the diff was read verbatim and confirmed to be **genuinely metadata-only** (two hunks: `generated_at` + `audit_trigger` pointer; overall + all 12 dimension scores byte-unchanged; `members-detail.js` 842 unchanged from AZ's committed baseline). Every claim is anchored to a quoted regen-all log line, a `git diff` hunk read verbatim, a `git log`/`git status` line, or a `test -e`/`test -d` absence check. No invented productivity, no lazy boilerplate where the facts diverged from prior cycles.

**Critic attests cleanly: substantive heartbeat cycle, honest metadata-only diff characterization (full-diff read, not reflexive echo), ship closes.**

# Cycle BB — overnight triage (EIGHTH cycle of 2026-05-30)

**Regen START** `2026-05-30T11:01:00Z` (= 07:01 EDT, York PA UTC-4 — both clocks agree on 2026-05-30, no journal-date tension). **~59m** after cycle BA (10:02:05Z) — **42nd consecutive ~1h-cadence cycle** since cycle M. **88th consecutive empty-inbox cycle.**

## Triage scope — BOTH queues ABSENT (heartbeat-only branch)

Verified by my own directory/file checks THIS cycle (not echoed):

- `.claude/state/founder-input-queue/` (dir) — **MISSING**
- `.claude/state/bug-reports/` tree — **MISSING** (no `inbox/`, no `triaged/`)
- `.claude/state/proactive-backlog.md` — **MISSING**
- `.claude/state/proposals/pending/` — only `.gitkeep` (0 real proposals)

The only `fiq`/`FIQ` artifact on disk is `.claude/state/aggregates/fiq-status.json` — a **Firestore Index** status file (acronym collision), **NOT** the Founder Input Queue (reads `status=green`, 26 declared / 26 deployed, 0 pending builds). Per the runbook fallback ("FIQ queue + bug-reports inbox BOTH empty → do steps 3–5 only"), this is a **heartbeat-only** cycle.

## Step 3a — `scripts/regen-all.ps1` (gating wrapper)

Ran end-to-end `11:01:00Z` → `ALL DASHBOARDS REGENERATED at 2026-05-30T11:01:05Z`, `=== ALL CHECKS PASSED ===`, round-trip test **PASS**. Heartbeat `regen-all-last-pass.json` written. **43rd consecutive clean canonical regen-all** (cycles L–BB).

All ~30 guards green: round-trip 4-view swap; transcript tallies (3 bubbles); nav 9-link ×9; meter-wiring 7/7; founder-queue 7/7; quota-type-enum; cross-dash `proposals_pending=0`; lifecycle proposals `shipped=7`; amendments `applied=28`; escalations `applied=3`; theme convergence (no raw hex); no-charts; protected-layouts 5/5 + 23/23; 17 swatches; W1.S1; proposal-readiness 0 deferred; install-scripts 7 parse; install-cmd-surface; scroll-reachability 5/0/0; quota-status auto-derived; pause-discipline clean; wiring 5/5.

Telemetry: `events=17126 handoffs=1 bubbles=7 proposals_pending=0`, `meter_status=wired-real` → **HALT-25 NOT in effect**. Token aggregate (all-time): `real=12,891,320,301 estimated=14,930,970 manual=0`.

One **informational** `~` (not a failure): user-context-gate flags `main-flows.html` modified 22133.5 min after last user-context capture (2026-05-14T23-07-48Z) — benign on a heartbeat-only night.

### app-health diff — HONEST: purely metadata this cycle

Cycle BB's `docs/reports/app-health.html` diff is **purely metadata** — verified by reading the `git diff` verbatim AND grepping the full diff for any `score`/`grade`/`weak_point`/`dimension` change (**zero matches**). Exactly two hunks:

1. `generated_at` `2026-05-30T10:51:47.961080Z` → `11:01:05.085902Z`
2. `audit_trigger` pointer re-pointed: `41e72ea0` (*"fix(calendar): restyle Range quick-action as slate peer (v8.23.54)"*, `trigger=app-commit`, `is_app_commit=true`, `app_files_touched=[public/sw.js, src/core/utils.js, src/pages/caddynotes.js, src/pages/calendar.js]`, 5 files) → `5a10b18b` (*"cron(routine): post-commit dashboard regen (AMD-019 + AMD-020 Class A auto-clean)"*, `trigger=cron`, `is_app_commit=false`, `app_files_touched=[]`, 4 files)

`overall_score` stays **87.1 (A-)**, `overall_grade` A-, and **all 12 dimension scores byte-unchanged**. I am stating metadata-only plainly because both the verbatim read and the grep confirm it — no manufactured "catch" in either direction.

## Step 3b — Wellness refresh

- `.claude/state/wellness/engineer.json` — updated for cycle BB (counters ~1,400k tokens cumulative / 1.0h discrete-context; status `active`; `thresholds_crossed=['tokens_consumed']` preserved 52nd cross-cycle; full cycle-BB `_note` + `substantive_output_at_checkpoint`).
- `.claude/state/wellness/critic.json` — updated for cycle BB. Critic participated via the closing METRIC_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL 3.1 attestation + independent full-diff verification (verbatim read + grep), confirming the diff genuinely IS metadata-only and refusing to manufacture a busywork proposal. Counters ~305k tokens cumulative / 1.0h; status `active`; threshold preserved.

| Metric | Count |
|---|---|
| FIQ entries triaged | 0 (queue absent) |
| Bug reports processed | 0 (inbox absent) |
| New proposals authored | 0 |
| Wellness state changes | 2 (engineer.json + critic.json cycle BB refresh) |

FIQ grade distribution: A=0 B=0 C=0 D=0 F=0 (no entries graded — queue absent).

## Blockers requiring Founder attention (cycle BB)

**No ship-blocking issues introduced by triage.** Awareness / carry-over items:

1. **Concurrent session shipped v8.23.50 → v8.23.54.** Since cycle BA (HEAD `8a436a40`), the concurrent session committed through `5a10b18b` (current HEAD), including v8.23.53 (branded per-course thumbnail monograms) and v8.23.54 (calendar Range quick-action restyle). Normal post-commit Founder review, not a triage blocker.
2. **`src/pages/members-detail.js` remains over the AMD-027 800-line budget (842).** Existing architecture weak_point, **not** triage-caused. **No proposal manufactured** — authoring an AMD-027 split proposal for a file another author is actively shipping would be both ship-count gaming (Rule 2) and a collision risk.
3. **Founder-checklist `open=6`** — residual concurrent-ship drift (red=0 yellow=4 green=2 closed=25); red=0 so nothing ship-blocking.
4. **Carry-over — concurrent emulator log `.claude/state/emu-unified-2026-05-29.log`** is dirty (a live emulator session's territory). Deliberately **not staged**.
5. **Carry-over — untracked other-tooling artifacts**: `.claude/state/overnight-agent/reports/2026-05-30.md` + `.claude/state/stop-decisions/2026-05-30.ndjson` + `playnow-survey.png` (concurrent-session output). Deliberately **not staged**.
6. **Carry-over — writer-side BOM fix (`scripts/common.ps1`)** remains unauthored as a proposal. Consumer-side `utf-8-sig` tolerance has held 43 consecutive clean regen-all runs (cycles L–BB). Deliberately not auto-promoted without a Founder priority signal.
7. **Carry-over — journal-date convention (UTC vs Founder-local)** for filename + commit date. Not in tension this cycle (both = 2026-05-30) but unresolved as policy.
8. **Cron cadence** — cycles M–BB steady at ~1h (42 consecutive). Awareness only.

## Cycle BB Critic metric-integrity attestation (per `METRIC_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL § 3.1`)

1. **"Did every bug report processed get a real diagnosis with cited evidence?"** N/A — zero bug reports tonight (inbox tree absent, verified by directory checks this cycle). Cannot wave off what doesn't exist.
2. **"Did every new proposal cite a specific screen/state/edge-case?"** N/A — zero new proposals tonight. The `members-detail.js` over-budget and the BOM fix were both deliberately *not* promoted rather than inflated into proposals.
3. **"Did the FIQ grades reflect rubric dimensions honestly?"** N/A — zero FIQ entries tonight. Queue absent.

**Heartbeat-only self-check — is tonight's substantive output real?** YES. A 43rd consecutive clean canonical regen-all confirms the gate is durable. This cycle's integrity discipline was confirming the diff is **genuinely metadata-only** via two independent methods (verbatim hunk read + grep of the full diff for any score/grade/dimension delta → zero matches; overall + all 12 dimension scores byte-unchanged). Every claim is anchored to a quoted regen-all log line, a `git diff` hunk read verbatim, a `git log`/`git status` line, or a `test -e`/`test -d` absence check. No invented productivity.

**Critic attests cleanly: substantive heartbeat cycle, honest metadata-only diff characterization (verbatim read + grep, not reflexive echo), ship closes.**

# Cycle BC — overnight triage (2026-05-30T12:01Z)

**Branch:** heartbeat-only (runbook "BOTH queues empty → steps 3–5 only"). NINTH cycle of the 2026-05-30 date (AU 04:04Z · AV 05:01Z · AW 06:01Z · AX 07:00Z · AY 08:01Z · AZ 09:01Z · BA 10:02Z · BB 11:01Z · **BC 12:01Z**). BB→BC gap ≈ 60 min — **43rd consecutive ~1h-cadence cycle** since cycle M.

## Steps 1 + 2 — Triage (skipped, queues empty)

Verified by my own directory-absence checks THIS cycle (not echoed from BB):

- `.claude/state/founder-input-queue/` — **dir MISSING**
- `.claude/state/bug-reports/` tree (no `inbox/`, no `triaged/`) — **MISSING**
- `.claude/state/proactive-backlog.md` — **MISSING**
- `.claude/state/proposals/pending/` — only `.gitkeep` (0 real proposals)

**89th consecutive empty-inbox cycle.** No FIQ entries to grade, no bug reports to diagnose, no proposals to author. Per runbook, skip steps 1–2.

## Step 3a — regen-all heartbeat

`scripts/regen-all.ps1` ran end-to-end `2026-05-30T12:01:18Z` → **`ALL DASHBOARDS REGENERATED at 2026-05-30T12:01:23Z`** with **`=== ALL CHECKS PASSED ===`** + round-trip test **PASS**. **44th consecutive clean canonical regen-all (cycles L–BC.)** Heartbeat `regen-all-last-pass.json` written.

- Telemetry: `events=17191 handoffs=1 bubbles=7 proposals_pending=0`, `meter_status=wired-real` → **HALT-25 NOT in effect**.
- Token aggregate (all-time): `real=12,953,609,505 estimated=14,981,280 manual=0`.
- One **informational** `~` (not a failure): `user-context-gate` flags `main-flows.html` modified 22193.8 min after last user-context capture (`2026-05-14T23-07-48Z`) — benign on a heartbeat-only night.

### Honest diff characterization (cycle BC)

`docs/reports/app-health.html` diff is **purely metadata** — verified by reading the `git diff` verbatim. Exactly two hunks:

1. `generated_at` `2026-05-30T11:58:12.872107Z` → `12:01:23.137551Z`
2. `audit_trigger` pointer re-pointed: `6d6f49c1` (*"fix(chat): center empty Trash Talk feed in its frame instead of pinning over a void (v8.23.59)"*, `trigger=app-commit`, `is_app_commit=true`, `app_files_touched=[public/sw.js, src/core/utils.js, src/pages/chat.js, src/styles/components.css]`, 5 files) → `56ddc4ca` (*"cron(routine): post-commit dashboard regen (AMD-019 + AMD-020 Class A auto-clean)"*, `trigger=cron`, `is_app_commit=false`, `app_files_touched=[]`, 4 files)

`overall_score` stays **87.1 (A-)**, `overall_grade` A-, and **all 12 dimension scores byte-unchanged** — `overall_score`/`overall_grade` appear in the diff only as unchanged context lines (no `+/-` prefix). Stated metadata-only plainly; no manufactured "catch" in either direction.

## Step 3b — Wellness refresh

- `.claude/state/wellness/engineer.json` — updated for cycle BC (counters ~1,430k tokens cumulative / 1.0h discrete-context; status `active`; `thresholds_crossed=['tokens_consumed']` preserved 53rd cross-cycle).
- `.claude/state/wellness/critic.json` — updated for cycle BC. Critic participated via the closing METRIC_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL 3.1 attestation + independent verbatim full-diff verification, confirming the diff genuinely IS metadata-only and refusing to manufacture a busywork proposal. Counters ~315k tokens cumulative / 1.0h; status `active`; threshold preserved.

## Step 4 — Session journal

**This section** (cycle BC appended to the existing 2026-05-30 date journal).

## Cycle BC counts

| Metric | Count |
|---|---|
| FIQ entries triaged | 0 (queue absent) |

| Wellness state changes | 2 (engineer.json + critic.json cycle BC refresh) |

FIQ grade distribution: A=0 B=0 C=0 D=0 F=0 (no entries graded — queue absent).

## Blockers requiring Founder attention (cycle BC)

**No ship-blocking issues introduced by triage.** Awareness / carry-over items:

1. **Concurrent session shipped v8.23.54 → v8.23.59.** Since cycle BB (HEAD `5a10b18b`), the concurrent session committed through `56ddc4ca` (current HEAD), including v8.23.58 (chat composer/bottom-nav overlap fix) and v8.23.59 (chat empty-feed centering). Normal post-commit Founder review, not a triage blocker.
2. **Founder-checklist `open=6`** — residual concurrent-ship drift (red=0 yellow=4 green=2 closed=25); red=0 so nothing ship-blocking.
3. **Carry-over — concurrent emulator log `.claude/state/emu-unified-2026-05-29.log`** is dirty (a live emulator session's territory). Deliberately **not staged**.
4. **Carry-over — untracked other-tooling artifacts**: `.claude/state/overnight-agent/reports/2026-05-30.md` + `.claude/state/stop-decisions/2026-05-30.ndjson` + `crit-home-82359.png` (concurrent-session output; BB's `playnow-survey.png` no longer present). Deliberately **not staged**.
5. **Carry-over — writer-side BOM fix (`scripts/common.ps1`)** remains unauthored as a proposal. Consumer-side `utf-8-sig` tolerance has held 44 consecutive clean regen-all runs (cycles L–BC). Deliberately not auto-promoted without a Founder priority signal.
6. **Carry-over — journal-date convention (UTC vs Founder-local)** for filename + commit date. Not in tension this cycle (both = 2026-05-30) but unresolved as policy.
7. **Cron cadence** — cycles M–BC steady at ~1h (43 consecutive). Awareness only.
8. **Carry-over — wellness token-counter semantics** — `thresholds_crossed=['tokens_consumed']` persists (engineer ~1,430k / critic ~315k cumulative since last rest); status remains `active` because heartbeat-only nights are genuinely light. Founder-decision still LIVE: (a) reset per cron fire, (b) raise threshold, (c) auto-trigger rest when crossed-while-active, (d) leave current convention (current path).

## Cycle BC Critic metric-integrity attestation (per `METRIC_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL § 3.1`)

1. **"Did every bug report processed get a real diagnosis with cited evidence?"** N/A — zero bug reports tonight (inbox tree absent, verified by directory checks this cycle). Cannot wave off what doesn't exist.
2. **"Did every new proposal cite a specific screen/state/edge-case?"** N/A — zero new proposals tonight. The BOM fix was deliberately *not* promoted rather than inflated into a proposal.
3. **"Did the FIQ grades reflect rubric dimensions honestly?"** N/A — zero FIQ entries tonight. Queue absent.

**Heartbeat-only self-check — is tonight's substantive output real?** YES. A 44th consecutive clean canonical regen-all confirms the gate is durable. This cycle's integrity discipline was confirming the diff is **genuinely metadata-only** via a verbatim hunk read (overall + all 12 dimension scores appear only as unchanged context lines). Every claim is anchored to a quoted regen-all log line, a `git diff` hunk read verbatim, a `git log`/`git status` line, or a `test -e`/`test -d` absence check. No invented productivity.

**Critic attests cleanly: substantive heartbeat cycle, honest metadata-only diff characterization (verbatim read, not reflexive echo), ship closes.**

## Pause-discipline note (cycle BC)

Ran ~5 state-changing operations (regen-all + engineer.json + critic.json + this journal + the commit). **No API-error / org-cap signal** appeared in any tool result. Per the F1a defensive heuristic — *"the actual choice is judgment, not threshold-driven … over-pause beats under-pause"* — exiting clean at op 5 would have left a dirty, uncommitted tree (worse outcome) with no quota pressure to justify it, so I completed the commit. Documented here for retrospective review.

# Cycle BD — overnight triage (2026-05-30T13:01Z)

**Branch:** heartbeat-only (runbook "BOTH queues empty → steps 3–5 only"). TENTH cycle of the 2026-05-30 date (AU 04:04Z · AV 05:01Z · AW 06:01Z · AX 07:00Z · AY 08:01Z · AZ 09:01Z · BA 10:02Z · BB 11:01Z · BC 12:01Z · **BD 13:01Z**). BC→BD gap ≈ 60 min — **44th consecutive ~1h-cadence cycle** since cycle M.

## Steps 1 + 2 — Triage (skipped, queues empty)

Verified by my own directory-absence checks THIS cycle (not echoed from BC):

- `.claude/state/founder-input-queue/` — **dir MISSING**
- `.claude/state/bug-reports/` tree (no `inbox/`, no `triaged/`) — **MISSING**
- `.claude/state/proactive-backlog.md` — **MISSING**

**90th consecutive empty-inbox cycle.** No FIQ entries to grade, no bug reports to diagnose, no proposals to author. Per runbook, skip steps 1–2.

## Step 3a — regen-all heartbeat

`scripts/regen-all.ps1` ran end-to-end `2026-05-30T13:01:38Z` → **`ALL DASHBOARDS REGENERATED at 2026-05-30T13:01:44Z`** with **`=== ALL CHECKS PASSED ===`** + round-trip test **PASS**. **45th consecutive clean canonical regen-all (cycles L–BD.)** Heartbeat `regen-all-last-pass.json` written.

- Telemetry: `events=17254 handoffs=1 bubbles=7 proposals_pending=0`, `meter_status=wired-real` → **HALT-25 NOT in effect**.

- `regen-main-flows` emitted its standing WARN of 6 orphan components in the grid (`actor.guest`, `actor.invitee`, `dist.capacitor-ios`, `ext.open-meteo`, `fn.expire-suspensions`, `fn.join-league`) — long-standing informational, not a regression; round-trip still verifies 6 cols / 47 components / 62 flows / 248 steps, all refs resolve.

### Honest diff characterization (cycle BD)

`docs/reports/app-health.html` diff is **purely metadata** — verified by reading the `git diff` verbatim AND grepping for `+/-` on score lines. Exactly two hunks:

1. `generated_at` `2026-05-30T12:55:34.761679Z` → `13:01:43.445508Z`
2. `audit_trigger` pointer re-pointed: `4386ae64` (*"fix: honest 9-hole to-par across all surfaces (v8.23.63)"*, `trigger=app-commit`, `is_app_commit=true`, `app_files_touched=[public/sw.js, src/core/handicap.js, src/core/router-sharecard.js, src/core/utils.js, src/pages/caddynotes.js, src/pages/calendar.js, src/pages/chat-calendar.js, src/pages/feed.js, src/pages/home-hq.js, src/pages/members-detail.js]`, 12 files) → `b0bfa5a9` (*"cron(routine): post-commit dashboard regen (AMD-019 + AMD-020 Class A auto-clean)"*, `trigger=cron`, `is_app_commit=false`, `app_files_touched=[]`, 4 files)

`overall_score` stays **87.1 (A-)**, `overall_grade` A-, and **all 12 dimension scores byte-unchanged** — a grep for `+/-` on `overall_score`/`overall_grade`/`score` lines returns **nothing**; they appear only as unchanged context. The 8-insertion / 19-deletion line delta is **entirely** the `app_files_touched` array shrinking 12→0. Stated metadata-only plainly; no manufactured "catch" in either direction.

## Step 3b — Wellness refresh

- `.claude/state/wellness/engineer.json` — updated for cycle BD (counters ~1,440k tokens cumulative / 1.0h discrete-context; status `active`; `thresholds_crossed=['tokens_consumed']` preserved 54th cross-cycle).

# Cycle BE — overnight triage (2026-05-30T14:01Z)

**Branch:** heartbeat-only (runbook "BOTH queues empty → steps 3–5 only"). ELEVENTH cycle of the 2026-05-30 date (AU 04:04Z · AV 05:01Z · AW 06:01Z · AX 07:00Z · AY 08:01Z · AZ 09:01Z · BA 10:02Z · BB 11:01Z · BC 12:01Z · BD 13:01Z · **BE 14:01Z**). BD→BE gap ≈ 60 min — **45th consecutive ~1h-cadence cycle** since cycle M.

## Steps 1 + 2 — Triage (skipped, queues empty)

Verified by my own directory-absence checks THIS cycle (not echoed from BD):

- `.claude/state/founder-input-queue/` — **dir MISSING**
- `.claude/state/bug-reports/` tree (no `inbox/`, no `triaged/`) — **MISSING**
- `.claude/state/proactive-backlog.md` — **MISSING**
- `.claude/state/founder_input_queue.json` — **MISSING**
- `.claude/state/proposals/pending/` — only `.gitkeep` (0 real proposals)

**91st consecutive empty-inbox cycle.** No FIQ entries to grade, no bug reports to diagnose, no proposals to author. Per runbook, skip steps 1–2.

## Step 3a — regen-all heartbeat

`scripts/regen-all.ps1` ran end-to-end `2026-05-30T14:01:35Z` → **`ALL DASHBOARDS REGENERATED at 2026-05-30T14:01:41Z`** with **`=== ALL CHECKS PASSED ===`** + round-trip test **PASS**. **46th consecutive clean canonical regen-all (cycles L–BE.)** Heartbeat `regen-all-last-pass.json` written.

- Telemetry: `events=17311 handoffs=1 bubbles=7 proposals_pending=0`, `meter_status=wired-real` → **HALT-25 NOT in effect**.
- Token aggregate (all-time): `real=13,053,077,799 estimated=15,113,490 manual=0`.
- One **informational** `~` (not a failure): `user-context-gate` flags `main-flows.html` modified 22314.1 min after last user-context capture (`2026-05-14T23-07-48Z`) — benign on a heartbeat-only night.
- `regen-main-flows` emitted its standing WARN of 6 orphan components (`actor.guest`, `actor.invitee`, `dist.capacitor-ios`, `ext.open-meteo`, `fn.expire-suspensions`, `fn.join-league`) — long-standing informational, not a regression; round-trip still verifies 6 cols / 47 components / 62 flows / 248 steps, all refs resolve.
- **Founder-checklist count MOVED this cycle:** `regen-founder-checklist` reported `open=4 (red=0 yellow=4 green=0) closed_total=27` — a real change from cycles BA–BD's `open=6 (red=0 yellow=4 green=2) closed_total=25`. Two green items closed (closed 25→27, green 2→0), driven by the concurrent session's edits to the 12 dirty `.claude/state/task-queue/founder/*.md` source items. Not heartbeat-caused; red=0 so nothing ship-blocking. Surfaced honestly rather than echoing the stale `open=6` figure.

### Honest diff characterization (cycle BE) — TWO change classes, not a uniform "metadata-only" echo

This cycle the working-tree diff has **two distinct classes**, and I deliberately did **not** stretch a single "purely metadata" framing across both:

**Class 1 — `docs/reports/app-health.html` IS purely metadata.** Verified by reading the `git diff` verbatim AND grepping for `+/-` on `overall_score`/`overall_grade`/`score`/`weak_point`/`dimension` lines (**zero matches**). Exactly two hunks:
1. `generated_at` `2026-05-30T13:38:15.143790Z` → `14:01:40.500817Z`
2. `audit_trigger` pointer re-pointed: `2ae2ede3` (*"fix(calendar): harmonize color taxonomy — one color per concept, distinguishable categories (v8.23.65)"*, `trigger=app-commit`, `is_app_commit=true`, `app_files_touched=[public/sw.js, src/core/utils.js, src/pages/caddynotes.js, src/pages/calendar.js, src/styles/components.css]`, 6 files) → `1e4fa728` (*"cron(routine): post-commit dashboard regen (AMD-019 + AMD-020 Class A auto-clean)"*, `trigger=cron`, `is_app_commit=false`, `app_files_touched=[]`, 4 files)

`overall_score` stays **87.1 (A-)**, `overall_grade` A-, all 12 dimension scores byte-unchanged (they appear only as unchanged context lines).

**Class 2 — `templates/dashboards/founder-checklist.template.html` is NOT mine and NOT metadata.** Run-start `git status` (14:01:25Z) did **not** list this template; after my regen it shows **+30/-1** lines ADDING a hand-authored `.fc-guide` collapsible *"New here? How a developer uses this checklist"* onboarding section (CSS block + `<details>` walkthrough + a rewritten hero paragraph reframed around "who can clear it"). **Decisive proof this is not my regen's output:** `grep -c` of BOTH the committed (`git show HEAD:scripts/regen-founder-checklist.py`) AND the working-tree generator for `fc-guide|New here? How a developer|fc-guide-step-label` returns **0** — the generator literally cannot emit that block, and it is not itself dirty. Therefore the guide block is the **live concurrent session's direct hand-edit** to the template, landed during my cycle window (cf. the cycle-AZ "live-edit-during-cycle" precedent), **entangled** in one file with my regen's legitimate checklist count update (open 6→4 etc.). Because I cannot cleanly isolate my count-regen contribution from the concurrent author's in-flight onboarding-feature authoring within a single file, I left the **entire `founder-checklist.template.html` UNSTAGED** — committing it would finalize another author's unreviewed, Founder-facing onboarding feature, crossing the runbook *"DO NOT auto-anything that crosses a Founder-decision boundary"* line.

## Step 3b — Wellness refresh

- `.claude/state/wellness/engineer.json` — updated for cycle BE (counters ~1,450k tokens cumulative / 1.0h discrete-context; status `active`; `thresholds_crossed=['tokens_consumed']` preserved 55th cross-cycle; full cycle-BE `_note` incl. the two-class diff honesty).
- `.claude/state/wellness/critic.json` — updated for cycle BE. Critic participated via the closing METRIC_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL 3.1 attestation + independent verification, this cycle forcing the generator `grep -c` (=0) that proved the founder-checklist guide block is concurrent-author WIP, not regen output — catching what a reflexive "purely metadata" echo would have mis-committed. Counters ~325k tokens cumulative / 1.0h; status `active`; threshold preserved.

## Step 4 — Session journal

**This section** (cycle BE appended to the existing 2026-05-30 date journal).

## Cycle BE counts

| Metric | Count |
|---|---|
| FIQ entries triaged | 0 (queue absent) |
| Bug reports processed | 0 (inbox absent) |
| New proposals authored | 0 |
| Wellness state changes | 2 (engineer.json + critic.json cycle BE refresh) |

FIQ grade distribution: A=0 B=0 C=0 D=0 F=0 (no entries graded — queue absent).

## Blockers requiring Founder attention (cycle BE)

**No ship-blocking issues introduced by triage.** Awareness / carry-over items:

1. **Concurrent session is editing LIVE and shipped v8.23.63 → v8.23.65.** Since cycle BD (HEAD `b0bfa5a9`), the concurrent session committed through `1e4fa728` (current HEAD), shipping v8.23.64 (wager type-icons glyph→SVG, `8076e988`) and v8.23.65 (calendar color taxonomy harmonize, `2ae2ede3`). It is **also actively hand-authoring** a founder-checklist onboarding guide and editing 12 `task-queue/founder/*.md` items *right now* (those appeared dirty mid-cycle). Normal post-commit / in-flight Founder review, not a triage blocker.
2. **`templates/dashboards/founder-checklist.template.html` carries an in-flight onboarding-guide hand-edit (concurrent session).** Left **unstaged** this cycle (proven via generator `grep -c`=0 that my regen could not have produced the `.fc-guide` block; entangled with my count-regen so the whole file is left for the concurrent author / Founder). Self-resolves the moment that session commits its onboarding work.
3. **`src/pages/members-detail.js` remains over the AMD-027 800-line budget (842).** Existing architecture weak_point, **not** triage-caused. **No proposal manufactured** — authoring an AMD-027 split proposal for a file another author is actively shipping would be both ship-count gaming (Rule 2) and a collision risk.
4. **Founder-checklist `open=4` (down from 6; red=0 yellow=4 green=0 closed=27)** — residual concurrent-ship drift; red=0 so nothing ship-blocking.
5. **Carry-over — concurrent emulator log `.claude/state/emu-unified-2026-05-29.log`** is dirty (a live emulator session's territory). Deliberately **not staged**.
6. **Carry-over — untracked other-tooling artifacts**: `.claude/state/overnight-agent/reports/2026-05-30.md` + `.claude/state/stop-decisions/2026-05-30.ndjson` (concurrent-session / other-tooling output). Deliberately **not staged**.
7. **Carry-over — writer-side BOM fix (`scripts/common.ps1`)** remains unauthored as a proposal. Consumer-side `utf-8-sig` tolerance has held 46 consecutive clean regen-all runs (cycles L–BE). Deliberately not auto-promoted without a Founder priority signal.
8. **Carry-over — journal-date convention (UTC vs Founder-local)** for filename + commit date. Not in tension this cycle (both = 2026-05-30) but unresolved as policy.
9. **Carry-over — wellness token-counter semantics** — `thresholds_crossed=['tokens_consumed']` persists (engineer ~1,450k / critic ~325k cumulative since last rest); status remains `active` because heartbeat-only nights are genuinely light. Founder-decision still LIVE: (a) reset per cron fire, (b) raise threshold, (c) auto-trigger rest when crossed-while-active, (d) leave current convention (current path).
10. **Cron cadence** — cycles M–BE steady at ~1h (45 consecutive). Awareness only.

## Cycle BE Critic metric-integrity attestation (per `METRIC_INTEGRITY_PROTOCOL § 3.1`)

1. **"Did every bug report processed get a real diagnosis with cited evidence?"** N/A — zero bug reports tonight (inbox tree absent, verified by directory checks this cycle). Cannot wave off what doesn't exist.
2. **"Did every new proposal cite a specific screen/state/edge-case?"** N/A — zero new proposals tonight. The `members-detail.js` over-budget, the founder-checklist onboarding edit (concurrent author's), and the BOM fix were all deliberately *not* promoted rather than inflated into proposals.
3. **"Did the FIQ grades reflect rubric dimensions honestly?"** N/A — zero FIQ entries tonight. Queue absent.

**Heartbeat-only self-check — is tonight's substantive output real?** YES, and this cycle the integrity discipline did genuine work. A 46th consecutive clean canonical regen-all confirms the gate is durable. The new substantive observation: the working-tree diff this cycle is **two classes**, and rather than reflexively echoing BB–BD's "purely metadata" framing across everything, I separated them — confirmed `app-health.html` IS metadata-only (verbatim read + score-line grep), then **proved** `founder-checklist.template.html` is NOT my output via `grep -c`=0 of the generator (committed + working) for the guide text, attributing the `.fc-guide` onboarding block to a live concurrent hand-edit and leaving the whole file unstaged. The founder-checklist count movement (open 6→4, closed 25→27) was surfaced honestly rather than echoing the stale figure. Every claim is anchored to a quoted regen-all log line, a `git diff` hunk read verbatim, a `grep`/`grep -c` result, a `git log`/`git status` line, or a `test -e`/`test -d` absence check. No invented productivity, and no lazy boilerplate where the facts diverged from prior cycles.

**Critic attests cleanly: substantive heartbeat cycle, two-class diff honestly separated (app-health metadata-only by read+grep; founder-checklist template proven concurrent-author WIP by generator grep=0 and correctly left unstaged), ship closes.**

## Pause-discipline note (cycle BE)

Ran ~5 state-changing operations (regen-all + engineer.json + critic.json + this journal + the commit). **No API-error / org-cap signal** appeared in any tool result. Per the F1a defensive heuristic — *"the actual choice is judgment, not threshold-driven … over-pause beats under-pause"* — exiting clean at op 5 would have left a dirty, uncommitted tree (worse outcome) with no quota pressure to justify it, so I completed the commit. Documented here for retrospective review.

## Files changed in this cycle BE run

- `.claude/state/wellness/engineer.json` — cycle BE update
- `.claude/state/wellness/critic.json` — cycle BE update
- `.claude/state/cron/2026-05-30-overnight-run.md` — this journal (cycle BE section appended)
- `docs/reports/app-health.html` — regen output (metadata `generated_at` + `audit_trigger` commit-pointer `2ae2ede3`→`1e4fa728`; overall score/grade + all 12 dimension scores byte-unchanged at 87.1 A-)

NOT staged (live concurrent-session / other-tooling territory, via explicit pathspec): `templates/dashboards/founder-checklist.template.html` (concurrent session's in-flight `.fc-guide` onboarding hand-edit, proven via generator `grep -c`=0; entangled with my count-regen so the whole file is left), the 12 `.claude/state/task-queue/founder/*.md` files (concurrent checklist source edits), `.claude/state/emu-unified-2026-05-29.log`, `.claude/state/overnight-agent/reports/2026-05-30.md`, `.claude/state/stop-decisions/2026-05-30.ndjson`.

No code changes in cycle BE. No proposals. No FIQ writes. No bug-report state moves (inbox absent). app-health overall FLAT at 87.1 (A-); diff this cycle is two classes — app-health metadata-only (read+grep), founder-checklist template proven concurrent-author WIP (generator grep=0) and left unstaged.
