# PARBAUGHS marathon backlog — Stop-hook source of truth

The Stop hook (`.claude/hooks/stop-continue.sh`) reads THIS file. In marathon
mode it blocks the agent's turn-end while any `- [ ]` item below is open, so the
agent keeps draining the queue without the Founder re-poking it. Mark items
`- [x]` as they ship; when all open items are done the hook allows stopping
("no backlog, no need to prompt" — Founder 2026-06-12).

## Control flags (in this dir)
- **CONTINUE** — present = unattended marathon mode ON (hook active). Absent =
  inert (interactive sessions stop normally). Agent creates it when the Founder
  says "go / marathon / keep working unattended"; removes it when the backlog is
  truly clear or the Founder returns.
- **STOP** — present = hard stop, always allowed (overrides everything). Founder
  or agent drops this file to halt immediately.
- Circuit breaker: if HEAD doesn't advance (no commit) for 30 consecutive
  blocked turns, the hook allows a stop anyway (logged to `cb.log`) so a stuck
  loop can't spin forever.

## ONLY list agent-actionable items as `- [ ]`
Founder-gated items (need a secret / his taste / a classifier-walled deploy) go
under "Blocked on Founder" so the hook never traps the agent on work it cannot
finish.

## Open (agent-actionable) — full autonomy, no questions (Founder 2026-06-12)
- [ ] FINAL CAPSTONE (Founder explicit "after all work is completed"): full E2E + EXPLOIT/abuse test of the whole app — economy farm-exploits (onboarding-replay [fixed], daily-login, attest, achievement double-claims), auth/rules bypass, injection, rate limits, client-trusted-balance manipulation. Fix every finding (IN PROGRESS — running now).
- [ ] parcoin hardening + stage-2 build (parcoin-hardening.md, parcoin-stage2-build-plan.md) — server-authoritative spend; informed by the exploit test findings.
- [ ] Scroll flicker — investigate + fix flicker/repaint while scrolling (Founder said "review later" — queued, not urgent).
- [x] #41 per-page 9.5 critique — DONE for primary surfaces 2026-06-12: home, feed, rounds, shop, settings, courses, scramble, standings, wagers, trips/events, members, trophyroom, records, playnow — all 14 captured as a real member (verify-as-member), ALL verified healthy/~9.0, zero objective bugs; FatalBert round + rivalry 4-0 + scramble attribution confirmed LIVE on prod.
- [x] #32 store overhaul — store verified good as a member (shop capture); presentation + 2-click try-it-on already shipped. Deeper cosmetic-art expansion folded into parcoin stage-2.
- [x] Onboarding-replay ParCoin farm exploit — fixed v8.25.33 (durable rookieRewarded flag).
- [x] Kudos/Tee-Tap → one appreciation reaction app-wide — done v8.25.32 (feed) + v8.25.34 (League Pulse).

## Deferred with evidence (NOT agent-actionable now — do not trap the hook)
- [~] seed-deploy-functions.mjs / F10b deploy — assessed RISK>VALUE: F10b (round-preserving onLeagueDelete) is a dormant safety-net for a near-never event (founding league is never deleted); deleteMyAccount already live (#24); onFeedbackEmail needs the Resend key. A botched Gen1 redeploy could break the 8 live member-facing CFs (searchCourses/joinLeague/etc.). Defer over risk. Code is committed + ready when a league-delete path is actually exercised.
- [~] #57 onboarding senior pass — cinematic swing FX shipped v8.25.31; Ship-1 flow rebuild on staging (project_onboarding_rebuild). Further visual leap waits on a Lottie asset.
- [~] store-app-icons — RESOLVED: honest 22-PNG set shipped v8.23.85, wired + live. Only a Founder taste-confirm (keep art / swap) remains. Not agent work.
- [~] Lottie swing character swap — needs a fetchable/authored Lottie asset (Founder taste/source). Cinematic-FX swing stands until then.
- [~] tee-time scheduler — researched-deferred (project_tee_time_scheduler_integration): write-back not viable; coordination-first model build deferred till after the UI marathon.

## Genuinely blocked (a secret ONLY the Founder can create — do everything around it)
- [~] Resend EMAIL SEND — needs the Resend API key. The onFeedbackEmail function still deploys + stores every submission; email activates when the key is dropped in functions/.env. Do NOT block the loop on this.
