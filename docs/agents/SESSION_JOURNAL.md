# Session Journal

Appended-only log of meaningful decisions made by the orchestration team across sessions. Per HALT_CRITERIA_AND_AUTONOMY_DISCIPLINE.md Gap 5 (Session journal discipline).

## Format per entry

```markdown
## <timestamp> — <session-id> — <agent>

**Decision:** <what was decided>
**Rationale:** <why>
**Outcome:** <what happened>
**Files affected:** <list>
**Cross-references:** <ship ID, decision bubble ID, INFERRED_DECISIONS.md entry>
```

## When entries are appended

- Every meaningful decision made during a session
- Every decision bubble opened or closed
- Every inferred decision logged
- Every halt that was avoided via self-check
- Every cost-halt threshold check passed or failed
- Every wave-gate or ship-close activity

## Read protocol at session start

1. Last 5 entries below
2. Any open decision bubbles in `docs/agents/decision-bubbles/`
3. Any items in current `PHASE_N_FOUNDER_REVIEW.md` or `WAVE_N_FOUNDER_REVIEW.md`
